# How to link multiple trading accounts together in mql4

In MetaTrader 4 (MT4), you can link multiple trading accounts together by using the multi-terminal feature. This feature allows you to manage and trade multiple accounts from a single platform.

## To link multiple accounts in MT4:

Open the MT4 platform and log in to your account.
From the main menu, select "Tools" and then choose "Multi-Terminal".
A new window will open with a list of all the accounts associated with your MT4 profile.

To add a new account, click on the "Add Account" button and enter the login information for the account you want to add.

Repeat the process to add more accounts.
Once you have added all the accounts you want to link, you can manage and trade them all from the multi-terminal window.

You can also switch between accounts by selecting them from the drop-down menu at the top of the window.

Keep in mind that in order to link multiple accounts, you must have the appropriate permissions and access granted by the broker. 

If you are having trouble linking your accounts, you may need to contact your broker for assistance.
