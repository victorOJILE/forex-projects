# THE ROAD TO SUCCESS IN TRADING

## FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

Who remembers when fundamental analysis was considered the only real or proper way to make trading decisions?

Fundamental analysis attempt to take into consideration all the variables that could affect the relative balance and imbalance between the supply of and the possible demand for any particular stock, commodity or any financial instrument.

Using primarily mathematical models that weigh the significance of a variable and factors (interest rates, balance sheets, weather patterns, etc), the analyst projects that the price should be at some point in the future.

Ultimately, the fundamental trader could find that a prediction about where prices should be at a certain point in the future is correct. But in the meantime, price movement could be so volatile that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to stay in a trade in order to realize the objective.

## TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

A finite number of traders participate in the markets on any given day, week or month. Many of these traders do the same kind of things over and over in their attempt to make money.
In other words, some individuals develop behavior patterns, and a group of individuals, interacting with each other on a consistent basis, form collective behavior patterns.

These behavior patterns are observable, quantifiable, and they repeat themselves with statistical reliability. In a sense, technical analysis helps you get into the minds of the market to anticipate what's likely to happen next, based on the known patterns the market  generated at some previous moments.

## MENTAL ANALYSIS

I'm sure you already know, there can also be a huge gap between what you understand about the markets, and your ability to transform that knowledge into consistent profit steadily rising equity curve.

There's a big difference between predicting that something will happen in the market (and then think about all the money you could have made) and the reality of actually getting into and out of trading it. Doing it is actually as easy and stress-free as when you are just watching the market and thinking about doing it.

This might seem like a tall order, and to some of you it might be impossible. But it's not. There are people who have mastered the art of trading, who have closed the gap between the possible, available and their bottom-line performance. But as you might expect, these numbers are relatively small in number compared with the number of traders who experience varying degrees of frustration wondering why they can't create the consistent success they desire.

Trading successfully feels the same way. On any given day, week or month, the market makes available vast amount of money to anyone who has the capacity to put on a trade. Since the markets are in constant motion, money is constantly flowing.

All of these possibilities sound quite plausible, except when you consider that most of the trading industry failures are also some of the society's brightest and most accomplished people.
Furthermore, most of the industry's best market analysts are the worst persons imaginable.

If I have to distill all of the reasons to one, I will simply say that the best traders think differently from others.

What is different about the way the best traders think as opposed to how those who are struggling thinks? While the markets present endless opportunities, they simultaneously confront the individual with adverse psychological conditions.
At some point, every one who trades, learn something about the markets that will indicate when opportunities exist. But learning how to identify an opportunity to buy or sell doesn't mean you have learnt to think like a trader.

The difference is that, winners have attained a mindset - a unique set of attitudes - that allows them to remain disciplined. As a result, they're no longer susceptible to the common fears and trading errors that plaque others. Everyone who trades ends up learning something about the markets, very few people who trades ever learn the attitudes that are essential to becoming a consistent winner.

What I've discovered is that trading is full of paradoxes and contradiction in thinking that makes it extremely difficult to learn how to be successful. Traders start their careers with a fundamental lack of understanding what it means to be a trader with skills that are involved, and the depth to which those skills need to be developed.
