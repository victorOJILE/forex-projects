# TRADING AND ACCEPTING RISKS

Trading is inherently risky.

When you put on a trade, can you consider yourself a risk taker? 
The logical answer to this is YES. If I engage in an activity that's risky, then I should be a risk taker.
Do most traders believe that they are taking a risk when they put on a trade? Have they really accepted that the trade has a non-guaranteed, probable outcome? Furthermore, have the fully accepted the possible consequences? 

NO. most traders have no concept of what it means to be a risk taker in a way that a successful traders thinks about risk. The best traders not only take the risk but have also learned to embrace and accept that risk.
When you fully accept that risk, it will have profound implications on your bottom-line performance.

The best traders can put on a trade without the slightest bit of hesitation. They can get out of the trade - even when in loss - and doing so doesn't discomfort them emotionally.

If you're unable to trade without a bit of emotional discomfort (e.g fear), then you haven't learned how to accept the risks inherent in trading. Learning how to redefine your trading activities in a way that helps you to completely accept the risk, is the key to thinking like a successful trader.

All traders has been in a situation where they got into the market too soon - before the market has generated a signal, or too late but the trader hasn't convinced himself not to take a loss and, as a result, had it turned into a bigger one, he gets out of winning trades too soon; or found himself in winning trades but didn't take any profits at the right time, then let the trades turn into losers; or moved stop loss closer to the entry point only to get stopped out and the market goes back to his direction.

All these are errors traders make by themselves over and over again. These are not market-generated errors. Movements and information provided by the market gives each of us the opportunity to do something - that's all! The market doesn't have any power over the unique ways each of us interpretes these informations, or control of the decisions or actions we take as a result.

The best traders aren't afraid, because they have developed attitudes that gives them the greatest degree of mental flexibility to flow in and out of trades based on what the market is telling them. At the same time, the best traders developed attitudes that prevent them from getting reckless.

95% of trading errors you're likely to make - causing you to loose money - will stem from your attitudes about being wrong, loosing money, missing out and leaving money on the table. What I call the four primary trading fears.

When it comes to trading, your fears will act against you in such a way that you will cause the very thing you are afraid of, to happen.
You won't think about all other rational things you have learned about the markets until you are no longer afraid and the event is over. Then you will think to yourself, "I knew that, why didn't I think of it then", or "why couldn't I act on it then".
It is difficult to perceive that the source of these problems is our own inappropriate attitude. Many of the thinking patterns that adversely affect our trading are a function of the natural ways in which we were brought up to think and see the world.

The market offers too many - often conflicting variables to consider. There are no limits to the market's behavior. It can do anything at any moment. As a matter of fact, because anyone who trades is a market variable, any single trader can cause anything to happen. This means that no matter how much you learn about the market's behavior, no matter how brilliant an analyst you become, you will never be good enough to anticipate every possible way the market can make you wrong or cause you to loose money.

So if you're afraid of being wrong or loosing money, it means you will never learn enough to compensate for the negative effects these fears will have on your ability to be objective, to act without hesitation. Every trade has an uncertain outcome. Unless you learn to accept the possibility of an uncertain outcome, you will try consciously or unconsciously to avoid any possibility you define as painful. In the process, you'll subject yourself to self-generated and costly errors.

Note that over analyzing the market will not solve the trading problems created by lack of confidence, discipline and improper focus. When you operate from the assumption that more or better analysis create consistency, you will be driven to gather as many market variables as possible into your trading tools. 
But what happens then? You are still disappointed and betrayed by the market again and again, because of something you didn't see or give enough consideration to.
It will feel like you can't trust the markets; but the reality is, you can't trust yourself.

You won't be able to trust in yourself until you've trained your mind to override your natural inclination to think in ways that are counterproductive to being a consistently successful trader. You can learn how to redefine your trading activities in such a way that you truly see the risk, and you are no longer afraid.

When you've achieved a state of mind where you truly accept the risk, you won't have the potential to interpret market information in painful ways. If you can't trust yourself to be objective and to always act in your own best interests, achieving consistent result will be impossible.

The successful trader that you want to become is a future projection of yourself that you have to grow into. Growth implies expansion, learning and creating a new way of expressing yourself.
