Many of the reasons people are motivated to trade - the action euphoria, desire to be a hero, the attention one can draw when winning, or the self-pity that comes from loosing - create problems that will ultimately detract traders performance and overall success. 

Trading is an activity that offers the individual the freedom of creative expression that has been denied most of usfor most of our lives.

In the trading environment, we make most of the rules. There are very few restrictions on how we choose to express ourselves. Having unlimited possibilities comes with the unlimited freedom to take advantage of those possibilities, therefore presents the individual with specialized psychological challenges that very few people are properly equipped to deal with or have any awareness of that matter and people can't exactly work on overcoming something if they don't even know it's a problem.
