# Support and Resistance

In the Forex market, price action tends to converge on key support and resistance zones, where liquidity tends to concentrate. These areas act as 'magnets' for market participants, who often wait for price to reach these levels before entering the market.

Identifying these zones is crucial, and I focus on two primary timeframes:

1. Higher timeframes (Daily, 4-Hour): These charts provide a broader perspective, helping me pinpoint major support and resistance levels that have historically driven market sentiment.
2. Intermediate timeframes (1-Hour, 30-Minute): These charts allows me to identify mid-term support and resistance zones that can influence shorter-term price movements.

## Trading Support and Resistance

Once we've identified key support and resistance zones on higher timeframes (D, 4H, 1H, 30M, 15M), we wait for price to reach these areas. Then, we assess two possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Breakthrough

If price breaks through the zone, even with just a candle wick, we'll look for continuation or reversal entry opportunities using techniques like:

- Double top/bottom patterns
- Engulfing candle patterns
- Hammer candlestick patterns
- Retest to a previous FVG, Order Block, for more liquidity grab
- Flags and pennants

### Scenario 2: Rejection

If price fails to break through the zone and retraces, we'll confirm the rejection with an opposite candle on the 5M timeframe. Once confirmed, we'll take an instant entry in the direction of the rejection.

By following this approach, we can capitalize on both breakout and rejection scenarios, increasing our trading opportunities and potential for success.
