# ICT FVG Entry Setup

ICT FVG is a trading setup where institutional traders create a fake market move after a period of accumulation, mostly at the end of a trading session.

This action triggers market orders resting above or below the accumulation.

Immediately after, the market makes a sharp reversal, breaking previous swing level(s), thus shifting the market structure. 

This reversal often leaves a GAP after the Order Block that triggered the move, which becomes a target for price to pull back to, after the market structure shift.

This setup can occur as a trend reversal or a pullback in an existing trend, aiming to grab liquidity.


## Wait for the Pullback
Once the market structure shift occurs, wait for price to start pulling back. This pullback will provide an entry point for our trade.


## Enter the Trade (First Half)
Enter a trade with half our planned position size at the first opposite candle that triggered the structure shift (Breaker Block or BB).


## Monitor for Additional Entry Points
If price reaches the Fair Value Gap (FVG) after the BB, enter another trade with the remaining half of our planned position size.


## Alternative Entry Point
If price touches the order block in the manipulation zone, this can provide another entry point.
If price didn't go this far but returned according to our bias, we enter more trades after our first order


## Invalidating the Setup
If price consolidates slowly against our bias after touching the FVG or manipulation zone, it may be a sign of a fake setup. In this case:
If price breaks below the manipulation zone after the MSS, our setup is invalidated.
Place our stop-loss order at this point.


## Key Takeaways:
Identify the market structure shift and wait for the pullback.
Enter the trade in two halves: at the breaker block and potentially at the FVG.
Monitor for alternative entry points and invalidation signals.
Place stop-loss orders accordingly.


By following these steps, you can trade with market structure shifts and potentially profit from the resulting price movements.
