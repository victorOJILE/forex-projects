# Using Trendlines

A trendline is a visual representation of a trend's direction and momentum, created by connecting two or more significant price swings with a line. To accurately draw trendlines, we need to identify established or emerging trends, which provide the necessary swing points.

For optimal trendline analysis, we recommend using the:

- 30-minute (30M) timeframe
- 15-minute (15M) timeframe

These timeframes offer a balance between short-term market noise and longer-term trend developments, allowing us to identify reliable trendlines that can inform our trading decisions.


# Trading with Trendlines
## Rejection Setup

1. Wait for price to reach the trendline.
2. Confirm the rejection with an opposite candle on the 5M timeframe.
3. Enter a trade in the opposite direction of the point of contact.

## Accumulation Setup

1. Identify accumulation at the point of contact.
2. Wait for signs of manipulation, indicating a potential breakout.
3. Enter a trade in the direction of the breakout.
4. Close the previous trade (if applicable).

By combining trendline analysis with confirmation from shorter timeframes, you can increase the accuracy of your trades and capitalize on both rejection and breakout scenarios.


## Adapting to Volatile Markets

In highly volatile markets, trendline breakouts can be unpredictable and increase the risk of false entries. To mitigate this risk:

- Wait for price to retest the trendline after a breakout.
- Alternatively, wait for price to retest a midterm support or resistance zone.
- Enter a trade only after confirming the retest, ensuring a higher probability of success.

By exercising patience and waiting for confirmation, you can reduce the risk of entering a false breakout and increase the reliability of your trades.
